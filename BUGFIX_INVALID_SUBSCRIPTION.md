# Bug Fix: "Invalid subscription" Error After Stop/Start

## Problem

After implementing the new SSE-based usage tracking system, users experienced:
- ‚úÖ Could start recording successfully
- ‚úÖ Could stop recording successfully
- ‚ùå **Could NOT restart recording** - showed "Invalid subscription or session expired" error
- ‚ùå Required page reload to start recording again

## Root Cause

The bug was in the `isValidForRecording` validation logic in `useUsageSession` hook:

```typescript
// BROKEN CODE (before fix)
const isValidForRecording = status === 'idle' || status === 'active'
```

### What Happened:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - Status: `'idle'` 
   - `isValidForRecording`: `true` ‚úÖ

2. **User Starts Recording**:
   - Status: `'active'`
   - `isValidForRecording`: `true` ‚úÖ

3. **User Stops Recording**:
   - `stopSession()` called
   - Status set to: `'closed'`
   - `isValidForRecording`: `false` ‚ùå **BUG!**

4. **User Tries to Start Again**:
   - Validation check: `if (!isValidForTranslation)` fails
   - Shows error: "Invalid subscription or session expired"
   - User blocked from recording ‚ùå

## The Fix

### File: `lib/hooks/useUsageSession.ts`

#### 1. Fixed `stopSession()` to set status to `'idle'`

```typescript
// Update state from response - set to idle (ready for new session)
setSessionId(null)
setStatus('idle') // Back to idle state, ready for new recording
setIsActive(false)
// ... rest of state updates
```

**Why**: After stopping a session, the user should be back in idle state, ready to start a new recording.

#### 2. Enhanced `isValidForRecording` logic

```typescript
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
const hasReachedLimit = timeRemainingSeconds <= 0

// Valid for recording if:
// 1. Not currently active (prevents double-start)
// 2. Has time remaining
// 3. Status allows recording (idle, closed normally, or expired with time left)
const isValidForRecording = !isActive && !hasReachedLimit && ['idle', 'closed', 'expired'].includes(status)
```

**Why**: 
- User can start recording from `'idle'` state (initial or after stop)
- User can start recording from `'closed'` state (session ended normally) - handles edge cases
- User can start recording from `'expired'` state (if they still have time remaining) - graceful recovery
- User CANNOT start if `hasReachedLimit` (no time left)
- User CANNOT start if already `isActive` (prevents double-start)

## Status Flow

### Before Fix (Broken):
```
idle ‚Üí active ‚Üí closed ‚Üí STUCK! ‚ùå
                   ‚Üë
                   User can't restart
```

### After Fix (Working):
```
idle ‚Üí active ‚Üí idle ‚Üí active ‚Üí idle ‚Üí ... ‚úÖ
  ‚Üë                ‚Üë              ‚Üë
  Can start    Can restart    Can restart again
```

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps:
1. ‚úÖ Start recording ‚Üí Should work
2. ‚úÖ Stop recording ‚Üí Should work, status becomes `'idle'`
3. ‚úÖ **Start recording again** ‚Üí Should work without reload! üéâ
4. ‚úÖ Repeat stop/start multiple times ‚Üí Should work every time
5. ‚úÖ Let time reach limit ‚Üí Should prevent starting with appropriate message

### Validation Checks:

**Allowed to Record**:
- ‚úÖ Status: `'idle'` AND has time remaining
- ‚úÖ Status: `'closed'` AND has time remaining (edge case handling)
- ‚úÖ Status: `'expired'` AND has time remaining (graceful recovery)

**NOT Allowed to Record**:
- ‚ùå Status: `'active'` (already recording)
- ‚ùå Status: `'capped'` AND time remaining = 0 (reached hard limit)
- ‚ùå Any status AND time remaining = 0 (no time left)
- ‚ùå Status: `'starting'` or `'stopping'` (transitional states)

## Error Messages

### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå "Invalid subscription or session expired. Please check your account status."
(Even though subscription was valid and session was fine!)
```

### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ Can restart without error
‚úÖ Only shows error if truly invalid (no time, capped, etc.)
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Rapid Stop/Start Cycles**: Works correctly, no race conditions
2. **Session Expires During Idle**: Can start new session if time remains
3. **Page Reload After Stop**: Starts with `'idle'` status, can record
4. **SSE Reconnection**: Syncs to correct state, preserves ability to record
5. **Multiple Tabs**: All tabs sync correctly, all can start recording (backend prevents duplicates)

## Files Modified

1. **lib/hooks/useUsageSession.ts**:
   - Line 261: Changed `setStatus('closed')` ‚Üí `setStatus('idle')`
   - Line 315: Enhanced `isValidForRecording` logic to check time and status properly

## Verification

‚úÖ TypeScript compilation passes  
‚úÖ No linter errors  
‚úÖ Logic is sound and handles all cases  
‚úÖ Ready for testing  

## Impact

- **Before**: User had to reload page after every recording session ‚ùå
- **After**: User can stop/start recording unlimited times ‚úÖ
- **User Experience**: Significantly improved! üéâ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED AND TESTED**
