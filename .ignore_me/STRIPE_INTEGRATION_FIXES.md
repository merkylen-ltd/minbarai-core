# Stripe Integration - Production-Ready Fixes & Documentation

## Executive Summary

This document details comprehensive fixes and improvements made to the MinbarAI Stripe integration to ensure production-grade reliability, security, and compliance with Stripe best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Improvements ✅

**File:** `supabase/database.sql`

**Added:**
- `stripe_webhook_events` table for database-backed webhook idempotency
- Webhook event status tracking (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`)
- Audit trail for all webhook events with payload storage
- Retry count tracking for failed webhooks
- Performance indexes for webhook queries

**Functions Added:**
- `get_webhook_statistics()` - Monitor webhook health
- `cleanup_old_webhook_events()` - Automated cleanup of old events (keeps 90 days)

**Benefits:**
- **Idempotency:** Prevents duplicate webhook processing even with horizontal scaling
- **Audit Trail:** Complete history of all Stripe events for debugging
- **Monitoring:** Track webhook success rates and processing times
- **Compliance:** Maintains event logs for financial auditing

### 2. Webhook Handler - Complete Rewrite ✅

**File:** `app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts`

**Critical Improvements:**

#### Idempotency
- ❌ **Before:** In-memory Map (lost on server restart, not scalable)
- ✅ **After:** Database-backed with PostgreSQL unique constraints

#### Event Coverage
- ❌ **Before:** 6 events handled
- ✅ **After:** 16 events handled including:
  - `checkout.session.expired` - Track abandoned checkouts
  - `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Send trial ending reminders
  - `invoice.payment_action_required` - Handle 3D Secure authentication
  - `customer.updated` - Sync email changes
  - `customer.deleted` - Clean up deleted customers
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Track failed payments
  - `charge.dispute.created` - Alert on disputes
  - `charge.refunded` - Handle refunds
  - `payment_method.attached/detached/updated` - Track payment method changes

#### Error Handling
- Exponential backoff awareness (returns 500 for Stripe to retry)
- Detailed error logging with event IDs
- Status tracking in database for monitoring
- Graceful degradation on errors

#### Security
- Rate limiting per IP (100 req/min)
- Payload size validation (1MB max)
- Content-Type validation
- Comprehensive signature verification
- Client IP tracking and logging

### 3. Subscription Cancellation - Fixed ✅

**File:** `app/api/stripe/cancel-subscription/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- ❌ **Before:** Immediate cancellation (bad UX - customer loses access immediately)
- ✅ **After:** Cancel at period end (standard best practice)

**New Features:**
- `POST` endpoint: Cancel at period end (default, recommended)
- `DELETE` endpoint: Immediate cancellation (requires explicit confirmation)
- Handles subscriptions already marked for cancellation
- Syncs with Stripe to detect discrepancies
- Proper metadata tracking (canceled_at, canceled_by)

**User Experience:**
- User continues to have access until their paid period expires
- Follows Stripe's recommended practices
- Better alignment with customer expectations

### 4. Checkout Session - Enhanced ✅

**File:** `app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`

**Duplicate Prevention:**
- Checks database subscription status
- Cross-checks with Stripe API
- Syncs database if out of sync with Stripe
- Handles `active`, `trialing`, `past_due`, and `incomplete` subscriptions
- Prevents multiple concurrent subscriptions

**Additional Improvements:**
- Extended error handling with specific messages
- Session expiration (30 minutes instead of 24 hours)
- Metadata redundancy (both `metadata` and `client_reference_id`)
- Support for promotional codes
- Billing address collection
- Better logging for debugging

**Error Messages:**
- User-friendly messages in production
- Detailed messages in development
- Specific handling for rate limits, network errors, invalid prices

### 5. Subscription Upgrade/Downgrade - New Endpoint ✅

**File:** `app/api/stripe/change-subscription/route.ts` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Automatic proration handling
- Preview endpoint to show charges before changing
- Validates billing interval consistency (can't change monthly → yearly)
- Prevents changing to same plan
- Handles upgrades and downgrades
- Calculates prorated amounts
- Immediate database sync for better UX

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/stripe/change-subscription` - Execute plan change
  ```json
  {
    "new_price_id": "price_xxx",
    "proration_behavior": "create_prorations" // or "none", "always_invoice"
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/stripe/change-subscription?new_price_id=price_xxx` - Preview changes
  ```json
  {
    "preview": {
      "current_price_id": "price_aaa",
      "new_price_id": "price_bbb",
      "immediate_charge": 1500,
      "proration_amount": 500,
      "currency": "eur",
      "next_payment_date": 1234567890,
      "line_items": [...]
    }
  }
  ```

## Testing Scenarios

### Prerequisites
1. Install Stripe CLI: `stripe login`
2. Forward webhooks: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks`
3. Copy webhook secret to `.env.local`: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx`

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Successful Subscription Flow ✅
```bash
# 1. Create checkout session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"planId":"professional"}'

# 2. Complete checkout in returned URL
# 3. Verify webhook received: checkout.session.completed
# 4. Check database: subscription_status should be 'active'
# 5. Navigate to /dashboard - should have access
```

#### 2. Duplicate Subscription Prevention ✅
```bash
# 1. Complete a subscription (scenario 1)
# 2. Try to create another checkout session
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"planId":"professional"}'

# Expected: HTTP 400 with error "You already have an active subscription"
```

#### 3. Subscription Cancellation ✅
```bash
# Cancel at period end (recommended)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/cancel-subscription \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Verify:
# - Response: cancel_at_period_end = true
# - User still has dashboard access
# - Access expires at subscription_period_end

# Immediate cancellation (requires confirmation)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/cancel-subscription \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"immediate":true,"confirm":true}'

# Verify:
# - Response: status = 'canceled'
# - User immediately loses dashboard access
```

#### 4. Plan Upgrade/Downgrade ✅
```bash
# Preview change
curl http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/change-subscription?new_price_id=price_xxx \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/change-subscription \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"new_price_id":"price_xxx","proration_behavior":"create_prorations"}'

# Verify:
# - Webhook: customer.subscription.updated
# - Database updated with new status
# - Proration applied to next invoice
```

#### 5. Failed Payment ✅
```bash
# Use Stripe test card: 4000 0000 0000 9995 (decline)
# OR trigger via Stripe CLI:
stripe trigger invoice.payment_failed

# Verify:
# - Webhook received: invoice.payment_failed
# - Database: subscription_status = 'past_due'
# - User redirected to subscribe page
# - Webhook event logged in database
```

#### 6. Expired Card ✅
```bash
# Use Stripe test card: 4000 0000 0000 0069 (expired)
stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed

# Verify:
# - Webhook: payment_intent.payment_failed
# - Event logged in database
# - Stripe Smart Retry automatically attempts retry
```

#### 7. Dispute Created ✅
```bash
stripe trigger charge.dispute.created

# Verify:
# - Webhook: charge.dispute.created
# - Event logged in database
# - Admin alerted (console log)
```

#### 8. Webhook Idempotency ✅
```bash
# Send same webhook twice
stripe events resend evt_xxx

# Verify:
# - First: Processed successfully
# - Second: Logged as duplicate, not processed
# - Database has only one entry for event
```

#### 9. Database Sync After Out-of-Sync ✅
```bash
# 1. Manually cancel subscription in Stripe Dashboard
# 2. Try to create new checkout
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/checkout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"planId":"professional"}'

# Verify:
# - System detects discrepancy
# - Database synced with Stripe status
# - User informed of actual status
```

#### 10. Customer Portal Access ✅

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Database Queries for Monitoring

```sql
-- Webhook health (last 24 hours)
SELECT * FROM get_webhook_statistics(24);

-- Failed webhooks needing attention
SELECT 
  id,
  event_type,
  processing_error,
  retry_count,
  created_at
FROM stripe_webhook_events
WHERE status = 'failed'
  AND retry_count < 3
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Recent subscription changes
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.subscription_status,
  u.subscription_period_end,
  u.updated_at
FROM users u
WHERE u.updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
  AND u.subscription_status IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY u.updated_at DESC;

-- Subscriptions ending soon
SELECT 
  u.email,
  u.subscription_status,
  u.subscription_period_end,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (u.subscription_period_end - NOW())) / 3600 as hours_remaining
FROM users u
WHERE u.subscription_status = 'canceled'
  AND u.subscription_period_end IS NOT NULL
  AND u.subscription_period_end > NOW()
  AND u.subscription_period_end < NOW() + INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY u.subscription_period_end ASC;
```

### Automated Maintenance

```sql
-- Run daily (schedule in Supabase cron or external scheduler)
SELECT cleanup_old_webhook_events(90); -- Keep 90 days of events

-- Run weekly
SELECT cleanup_stale_sessions(); -- Clean up old usage sessions
```
